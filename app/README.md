# Code organization

## `./chrome`

This is where all the bootstrapping and privileged code should go.

## `./www`

This is where HTML and file assets go.

## `./www-sass`

This is where all the styling for HTML should go.

## `./www-jsx`

This is where all the scripting for HTML should go.

We are using React.js so please use JSX for DOM scripting.
Some ES6 features are enabled during the build phase.

`./www-jsx/main.js` - this is our entry point for code.
